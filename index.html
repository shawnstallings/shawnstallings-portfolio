			Front End Web Development is a great adventure. I have grown as a person and most of all I have learned to persevere. It has been awesome to work with the talented developers at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Over the last 15 years, I have worked in the customer service and systems training field. I liked training employees, but I really enjoyed evaluating the end user experience, to see how they are influenced by the design and programming choices made by the developers.<br><br>
			It was time for a change!  So with a diverse history in Graphic Design, Technical Service, Client and Employee Training development, I decided a career in Web Development would be a great choice. After taking a look around, you can learn more <a href="https://shawnstallings.github.io/about-me">about me here</a>.

			<h2>Outdoors-A-More!</h2>
			<h3>html / css / design / javaScript / ajax / api</h3>
				<p>
					This project was built from scratch, including concept, content and logo. Search parameters are used to make two Ajax calls. One from the Trail API and one from the Leaflet API, for the map. That data is filtered to show the user a list of outdoor activities in a specific area. Learning to decipher the remote API's took some time and research.

			<h2>Quiz Game</h2>
			<h3>html / css / design / javaScript </h3>
				<p>
					This project was built from scratch, including concept, content and logo. Javascript is used to track the users progress through the quiz. When the user submits their answers, they are given updated results as they take the quiz.

			<h2>Shopping List</h2>
			<h3>html / css / jquery </h3>
				<p>
					This is a project to strengthen my jQuery skills. It was very challenging to learn all of the methods that go into a small app like this. It was fun coming up with the name and designing the logo.

			<h2>AngularJS MadLibs Game</h2>
			<h3>html / css / angularJS</h3>
				<p>
					The goal of this project is to apply AngularJS to achieve the game functionality. I had to match the requested design specs that were given to me. The user puts key words into the form and submits them to reveal a funny story using their keywords. Angular is a change in philosophy from regular javascript, but I really enjoyed learning this. I have only scratched the surface with what Angular JS is capable of.

			<h2>Hot or Cold Guessing Game</h2>
			<h3>html / css / javaScript </h3>
				<p>
					Javascript is used mainly in this project. I was given the HTML and CSS already completed and then I added the functionality to the game. It's really awesome to watch friends and family play the game and enjoy the experience.

			<h2>Web Site Clone</h2>
			<h3>html / css / layout</h3>
				<p>
					This was my first project. Clone the look and feel of an existing site. The challenge was to create an exact match of the original.

			<h2>jQuery Streetfighter Demo</h2>
			<h3>html / css / jquery </h3>
				<p>
					The purpose of this site was to learn how a site can listen for and react to user input, such as a mouse click or pressing a keyboard key. Animation is fun!
